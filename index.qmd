:::{#hero-heading}
I'm a grade 10 student at Sri Kumaran's Children's Home school.  I love Maths and intend to pursue Commerce going forward. I have a keen interest in the financial market and would like to be eventually involved with it as I shape my career.

I am passionate about football. I play for my school's football and tabletennis teams. I have represented them in CBSE cluster tournaments  which progresses from a state to a national level competition involving  schools affiliated to CBSE board. 

I also play for the Young Blue Elite FC, an U17 elite team of the [Bengaluru FC Soccer School](https://www.instagram.com/bfcsoccerschools/?hl=en){target="_blank"}

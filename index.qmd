:::{#hero-heading}
I'm a grade 11 student at Sri Kumaran's Children's Home school.  I love Maths and intend to pursue business studies and economics going forward. I have a keen interest in the financial market and would like to be eventually involved with it as I shape my career.

I am passionate about football. I play for my school's football and table-tennis teams and have represented them in CBSE cluster tournaments (The CBSE cluster tournaments are inter school level competitions that progresses from a state to a national level competition among schools affiliated to the CBSE board). 

I have been playing football at the club level for the last 2 years as part of the U17 Young Blue Elite FC team [Bengaluru FC Soccer School](https://www.instagram.com/bfcsoccerschools/?hl=en){target="_blank"}. This year I will be a part of their U19 squad.

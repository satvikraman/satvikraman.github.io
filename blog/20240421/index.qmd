Cocoa is the new Bitcoin if you are into crypto currency or Nvidia if you like the good old stocks. From trading at $3000 a ton at the start of the year 2024, cocoa is now trading at $12000 a ton in April. A 4x multiple in just 3 months!!! And thats not the peak as per famed commodities trader, [Pierre Andurand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-andurand-b4a7725a/){target="_blank"}. He has bet big on Cocoa and predicts Cocoa futures to touch $20000 this year [^1].

In this article I try and explain what's happening and touch upon a few financial concepts along the way. 

::: {#nte-future .callout-note collapse="true"}
## What are Futures?
A future is a derivative contract that a buyer and seller get into. Because it is a derivative, it derives its value from an underlying asset, which could be a stock or a commodity. The contract attribute, standardizes the agreement by defining the quanta of the asset being traded and the pre-determined price of the asset on a pre-determined future date. The pre-determined future date is the date at which the contract expires. The buyer of the contract expects the price of the underlying to increase by expiry date, while the contract seller has an opposing view.

# The Cause
Cocoa production is extremely concentrated. The west African nations Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria produce a major share (over 75%) of the world's cocoa beans [^3]. A bad harvest in these nations brought on by El Niño, black pod disease and ageing cocoa trees has had a big impact on the supply side. Additionally, inequitable market practices done over decades have led to big chocolate corporations pocketing the bulk of the profit, leaving farmers with little income to replant new trees or implement disease prevention measures. Old cocoa trees mean two problems: lower yields and plants vulnerable to bad weather and diseases. Also, in Ghana, illegal gold mines have taken over areas of productive cocoa land. Put all this together, and it is not hard to reason why cocoa supply will remain in deficit for the third consecutive season in a row

The Russia-Ukraine war has also caused the prices of fertilizers to increase which has had a negative effect on the production of cocoa. Freight cost have also increased by 20% - 30% since the Isreal - Hamas war broke out and the Houthi rebels started attacking vessels in the Red sea in a show of support for Hamas, forcing cargo vessels to take a longer route avoiding the Seuz Canal.

## What is El Niño?
The term El Nino refers to the warming of the ocean. This often leads to drier and warmer conditions resulting in hotter weather, heavy rainfalls and intense heat waves etc. Conditions like excess moisture have led to the outbreak of the ‘Black pod disease’ affecting the cocoa harvest.

# How Are Businesses Responding?
In the last 30 years, cocoa demand has doubled. Further, beyond US and Europe, chocolate consumption per capita is relatively small, and one can expect these markets to grow creating new factors for demand. With demand outpacing supply, cocoa inventories across the world measured by the stock-to-use ratio will drop to as low as 25%, levels seen way back in the 1970s.

![Cocoa Inventory measured by stock-to-use ratio from 1961 to 2024](./CocoaInventory.webp "Title: Cocoa Inventory measured by stock-to-use ratio from 1961 to 2024"){height=200 fig-align=left #fig-cocoa-exports fig-alt="Figure showing cocoa inventory levels measured using the stock-to-use ratio from 1961 to 2024" .lightbox}


Businesses therefore have no choice but to respond. What exactly will they do, as with anything else, it depends. Manufacturers in the premium segment, like Lindt, typically have pricing power and can afford to increase prices of their products without denting their customer base. Chocolate prices in EU have already increased on an average by 6% - 8% annually. That's a nominal increase considering the cost of cocoa has gone up 4 times? Let me assure you, the chocolate manufacturers are not being generous and cushioning the price shock for the end customer. A chocolate contains more ingredients than cocoa powder, cocoa butter and cocoa nibs. The price hike of the end product, therefore isn't going to be proportionate to the increase in the cocoa prices. On the contrary, as per Bank of America, premium manufacturers intend to maintain the increased prices even after the cocoa prices decline helping them improve their margins in the coming years [^4].

Some businesses might absorb the price increase and reduce their margins, but that's not something that they can continue to do, if the prices continue to increase as projected through the year. This brings us to an important question. Can't buesinesses do anything to protect themselves against the vagaries of the market. The answer goes back to the concept we introduced earlier in this post - Futures Contract in @nte-future. Hersheys and other companies hedge their cocoa purchase by buying futures contract. While they don't use the futures contract to take physical delivery of the underlying (in this case cocoa beans), they use this strategy to minimise their loses should the market move against their views. 

However, many others will resort to what's called *Shrinkflation* and *Skimpflation*. Shrinkflation refers to the practice of reducing the pack size marginally in a way that it is not immediately noticeable to the end consumer. Nestlé has reduced their Kit Kat bar size from 17 to 14 grams., while Mars has reduced the size of its large milk chocolate Easter egg from 252 to 201 grams. Skimpflation on the other hand refers to the practice of changing the recipe of the product itself. Manufactures substitute the pricier ingredient with a cheaper substitute. For example, chocolates can be categorized into two major categories - [1] Couverture, that's made of cocoa butter and cocoa mass and [2] Compund chocolate, that's made of cheaper fats like vegetable, coconut or palm oil. Manufactures using coverture chocolates may substitute part of the recipe with compound chocolate to reduce the production cost, especially in lower income countries like India.

# The Way Forward?
The crisis in Africa presents itself as an opportunity for other countries specifically in Asia and the Americas. Farmers outside Africa with beans to sell are enjoying a windfall. Even otherwise, I think the crisis is a necessary one. Farmers need higher prices to be encouraged to replant old trees. As per @fig-cocoa-exports, countries in Africa and Europe have held the lions share of Cocoa beans export. Asian countries come next and they could potentially increase their market share and fill the gap between supply and demand. 

![Cocoa Exports from 1961 to 2021](./CocoaExports.png "Title: Cocoa exports per continent from 1961 to 2021"){height=200 fig-align=left #fig-cocoa-exports fig-alt="Figure showing the quantity of export of Cocoa beans per continent" .lightbox}

Specifically in India, the southern states of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu grow cocoa. Producers in these states could use this crisis as an opportunity to produce fine quality cacao beans. [Manam Chocolate](https://manamchocolate.com/pages/about-us){target="_blank"} is barely a year od, but has created a mark for itself by bagging the prestigous International Chocolate Award. Its sister brand, [Distinct Origins](https://www.distinctorigins.com/) is working actively towards enhancing both the quantity and the quality of cacao grown in the country. They are onboarding farmers and bringing in proprietary technologies to improve the fermentation, drying and other post harvest processes. This initiative will take 3 - 4 years to bear fruit but is a step in the right direction.

## What's the difference between Cacao and Cocoa?
I came across this word Cacao in a few articles that I read to research for this article. I genuinely thought it was a typo {{< iconify openmoji smiling-face-with-halo width="36" height="36">}}. Turns out its not. 
Cacao refers to the raw material: the cacao beans that are harvested from the cacao tree. Cocoa is created after the beans are finely ground into a powder and roasted, and can be consumed as a drink or blended with sugar, milk, cocoa butter and cacao to make chocolate.

The US Dollar, also known as the greenback, is the dominant reserve currency in the world. Around 60% of all international trade is setlled in the US dollar and most countries prefer storing the excess reservces in US dollars. Why is that countries prefer trading in the dollar, when that's not their local currency. This article tries to understand this puzzling practice.

# What is a reserve currency?
Before we go any further, we need to understand what a reserve currency is and its need. A reserve currency is a foreign currency that a central bank of a country holds its assets (reserves) in, besides its own local currency.

Many countries can not borrow money or pay for imported goods in their own currency, primarily because the country exporting the goods is not willing to trade in the importing country's currency. For example, if Indian traders were to import good from China, they would need to settle the trade in US dollars, rather than in Indian Rupees or the Chinese Yuan. Why? Because, Chinese exporters believe that the Indian Rupee is not stable and may lose value in the future. They therefore want to trade in a currency that they can hold without the risk of it losing its value, something that's considered to be stable, like the US dollar. 
 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the body responsible for monitoring the international monetary system, recognizes eight major reserve currencies: the Australian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar, the Chinese Renminbi, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the US Dollar. Among these, the US dollar is without any doubt the most commonly held reserve currency, making up 59% of global foreign exchange reserves. The Euro comes in a distant second, amounting to 20% of foreign exchange reserves.

# Why is the US Dollar so dominant?
Before the US dollar became the defacto reserve currency, each country would peg the value of its local currency with respect to the amount of gold it held in its reserve. Thus came the term "Gold Standard". It was technically possible to exchange the local currency for an equal amount in gold and hence each country was required to hold as much gold in its reserve as it had its currency in circulation. 

However, as World War I broke out in 1914, many countries suspended the gold standard to pay for their military expenses. And during World War II, the US served as the supplier of weapons for the Allies. Most countries paid for this in gold, making the US the largest owner of gold reserves by the end of the war. Since most countries had depleted their gold reserves a return to gold standard was impossible [^1].

## The Bretton Woods Agreement
In 1944, delegates from 44 allied countries agreed to peg their currency against the US dollar as an alternative to the gold standard. The US dollar was chosen since US held the largest gold reserves at that time and it agreed to continue to follow the gold standard. As per the agreement, a country could redeem its US dollar reserves for an equal amount of gold on demand. The US dollar was thus crowned the worlds reserve currency. 

The system seemed fair and not to anyones disadvantage. Countries retained some degree of control over their currency in case it became too strong or too weak relative to the dollar. They could sell or buy their currency to regulate money supply and bring their currency back to levels they felt comfortable  [^2]. 

## Does the US follow the gold standard even today?
Short answer, not any more. 

In due course of time, the US flooded the market with paper money to service demands for its US treasury securities and to fund its own domestic programs and its war in Vietnam. Sensing concerns over the stability of the US dollar, countries started converting their US dollars into gold. The demand for this conversion was so high, that President Nixon had to step-in and announce economic policies in 1971 (referred to as the Nixon Shock) delinking the US dollar and the gold, which led to the current system of floating echange rates.

# How does the US benefit?
The appetite for dollars among central banks across the world, provides US a cheap way to finance its expenditure. Given the demand, US can issue treasury securities at low yields and hence contain its cost to borrow money.

While not a financial benefit, the pivotal role the dollar plays in international trade, accords US the power to impose financial sanctions, and influence how countries repond to situations. Almost all trade done in US dollars, even trade between other countries where US is not involved, can be subject to US sanctions, because they are handled by correspondent banks with accounts at the Federal Reserve.

# Dedollarization
Dedollarization refers to groups of countries coming together and deciding to trade in their own local currencies, instead of the dollar, to remove their dependence on the dollar. While talks to dedollarize have always been happening in the background, it came into focus amidst recent geo-political tensions. After Russia invaded Ukraine, America froze nearly 640 billion dollars of Russia's foreign exchange reserves in US dollars. Countries fear that their assets may also be similarly frozen should they antoganize US [^3].

Alternatively, they fear that their US dollar reserves may get devalued should the dollar inflation set in. This could happen as a result of increased US deficit spending and printing of US treasury securities to support its debt.

China has for long tried to promote international use of its currency. Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are also opting to trade in national or alternative currencies for international settlements. For instance, Brazil is partnering with Argentia to launch a joint currency called "sur" (south) that may eventially become South America's Euro and get adopted by other countries of the continent. India is in talks with the UAE to trade non-oil commodities in Indian Rupees. Some central banks are touting Government backed digital currencies as an alternative. 

Amidst this debate, will the dollar lose its crown in the future. Well experts don't seem to think so, though they do believe it will lose its stranglehold and start sharing its influence with other currencies.

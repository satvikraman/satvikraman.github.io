<h1>Vodafone journey in India</h1>
<p>India is a massive market for telecom. It is the 2nd largest consumer of data. And while one would have expected a global brand like Vodafone, the 2nd largest telecom operator in the world, to have a dream run in India, it has been anything but that. So much so that, the parent group Vodafone sees no remaining value in its Indian operation and isn’t considering infusing any further cash into it, as per its consolidated financial statements for FY2023 <sup>1</sup>. In this post, I recall Vodafone’s journey in India and along the way touch upon and explain a few financial concepts.</p>
<p>Vodafone’s journey in India started in 2007, when it entered the country by acquiring a controlling 67% stake in Hutchison. The remainder of the stake was held by an Indian entity named Essar. Vodafone bought over Essar’s stake in 2014 once the Government allowed 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the telecom sector. And it journey hasn’t been snooth since. It first locked horns with Essar while trying to buy over its stake. Vodafone wanted to assess the market value of Essar’s 33% stake, while the latter wated a reverse merger. The court ruled in Essar’s favour and Vodafone had to fork out $5.46 billion to complete the acquisition. Then in 2012, when the Indian Government retrospectively ammended the Income Tax laws, it asked Vodafone to pay INR 14,200 crore in taxes, interest and penalty for its acquisition of its initial 67% stake in Hutchison. The case is currently being fought in the Internal Court of Justice. And just when it thought its troubles were over, Reliance Jio, entered the telecom market as a disruptive force in 2016 and triggered a price war that left many telcos bleeding. In 2017, Vodafone India announced merger with Idea Cellular creating Vi. Back then, the merged entity became the country’s largest telecom operator and was yet another attempt from Vodafone to make its Indian dreams come true.</p>

<p>Forward to today, and Vodafone’s woes havent ended. From being the largest telco operator in the country in 2017, it now stands third behind Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. It has been reporting quartely losses, losing subscribers month on month and its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), a key performance metric, is the lowest. The Indian Government became Vi’s largest shareholder in 2023 as part of a financial bailout package through which it converted the INR 16,130 crore that Vi owed it on spectrum and other license fee payments into a 33% equity in the telco. Vi’s debt stands at INR 2.15 lakh crore and is yet another case of too big to fail. Vi still has a market share of 21% <sup>2</sup> and to maintain a competitive market the Government has repeatedly expressed its stance against a duopoly in the telco sector. Further, the Government wouldn’t like the narrative and optics of a company as large and high-profile as Vodafone crashing in India, which could impact future FDI inflows into the country.</p>

<section id="whats-next" class="level1">
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>Vi needs more cash to expand its existing 4G network and rollout its 5G service. It is planning to raise INR 45,000 crore through debt and equity. Vi’s INR 18,000 crore FPO issue, the 2nd largest fund raising exercise in the country, is a part of this plan.</p>

</p><p>Cocoa is the new Bitcoin if you are into crypto currency or Nvidia if you like the good old stocks. From trading at $3000 a ton at the start of the year 2024, cocoa is now trading at $12000 a ton in April. A 4x multiple in just 3 months!!! And thats not the peak as per famed commodities trader, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-andurand-b4a7725a/" target="_blank">Pierre Andurand</a>. He has bet big on Cocoa and predicts Cocoa futures to touch $20000 this year <sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>A future is a derivative contract that a buyer and seller get into. Because it is a derivative, it derives its value from an underlying asset, which could be a stock or a commodity. The contract attribute, standardizes the agreement by defining the quanta of the asset being traded and the pre-determined price of the asset on a pre-determined future date. The pre-dertermined future date is the date at which the contract expires. The buyer of the contract expects the price of the underlying to increase by expiry date, while the contract seller has an opposing view.

<section id="the-cause" class="level1">
<h1>The Cause</h1>
<p>Cocoa production is extremely concentrated. The west African nations Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria produce a major share (over 75%) of the world’s cocoa beans <sup>3</sup>. A bad harvest in these nations brought on by El Niño, black pod disease and ageing cocoa trees has had a big impact on the supply side. Additionally, inequitable market practices done over decades have led to big chocolate corporations pocketing the bulk of the profit, leaving farmers with little income to replant new trees or implement disease prevention measures. Old cocoa trees mean two problems: lower yields and plants vulnerable to bad weather and diseases. Also, in Ghana, illegal gold mines have taken over areas of productive cocoa land. Put all this together, and it is not hard to reason why cocoa supply will remain in deficit for the third consecutive season in a row</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war has also caused the prices of fertilizers to increase which has had a negative effect on the production of cocoa. Freight cost have also increased by 20% - 30% since the Isreal - Hamas war broke out and the Houthi rebels started attacking vessels in the Red sea in a show of support for Hamas, forcing cargo vessels to take a longer route avoiding the Seuz Canal.</p>

<section id="how-are-businesses-responding" class="level1">
<h1>How Are Businesses Responding?</h1>
<p>In the last 30 years, cocoa demand has doubled. Further, beyond US and Europe, chocolate consumption per capita is relatively small, and one can expect these markets to grow creating new factors for demand. With demand outpacing supply, cocoa inventories across the world measured by the stock-to-use ratio will drop to as low as 25%, levels seen way back in the 1970s.</p>
<div id="fig-cocoa-exports" class="lightbox quarto-figure quarto-figure-left quarto-float anchored" alt="Figure showing cocoa inventory levels measured using the stock-to-use ratio from 1961 to 2024" data-fig-align="left">

<p>Businesses therefore have no choice but to respond. What exactly will they do, as with anything else, it depends. Manufacturers in the premium segment, like Lindt, typically have pricing power and can afford to increase prices of their products without denting their customer base. Chocolate prices in EU have already increased on an average by 6% - 8% annually. That’s a nominal increase considering the cost of cocoa has gone up 4 times? Let me assure you, the chocolate manufacturers are not being generous and cushioning the price shock for the end customer. A chocolate contains more ingredients than cocoa powder, cocoa butter and cocoa nibs. The price hike of the end product, therefore isn’t going to be proportionate to the increase in the cocoa prices. On the contrary, as per Bank of America, premium manufacturers intend to maintain the increased prices even after the cocoa prices decline helping them improve their margins in the coming years <sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>Some businesses might absorb the price increase and reduce their margins, but that’s not something that they can continue to do, if the prices continue to increase as projected through the year. This brings us to an important question. Can’t buesinesses do anything to protect themselves against the vagaries of the market. The answer goes back to the concept we introduced earlier in this post - Futures Contract in Note&nbsp;1. Hersheys and other companies hedge their cocoa purchase by buying futures contract. While they don’t use the futures contract to take physical delivery of the underlying (in this case cocoa beans), they use this strategy to minimise their loses should the market move against their views.</p>
<p>However, many others will resort to whats called <em>Shrinkflation</em> and <em>Skimpflation</em>. Shrinkflation refers to the practice of reducing the pack size marginally in a way that it is not immediately noticable to the end consumer. Nestlé has reduced their Kit Kat bar size from 17 to 14 grams., while Mars has reduced the size of its large milk chocolate Easter egg from 252 to 201 grams. Skimpflation on the other hand refers to the practice of changing the recipe of the product itself. Manufactures substitue the pricier ingredient with a cheaper substitute. For example, chocolates can be categorized into two major categories - [1] Couverture, that’s made of cocoa butter and cocoa mass and [2] Compund chocolate, thats made of cheaper fats like vegetable, coconut or palm oil. Manufactures using coverture chocolates may substitute part of the recipe with compound chocolate to reduce the production cost, especially in lower income countries like India.</p>

<section id="the-way-forward" class="level1">
<h1>The Way Forward?</h1>
<p>The crisis in Africa presents itself as an opportunity for other countries specifically in Asia and the Americas. Farmers outside Africa with beans to sell are enjoying a windfall. Even otherwise, I think the crisis is a necessary one. Farmers need higher prices to be encouraged to replant old trees. As per Figure&nbsp;5, countries in Africa and Europe have held the lions share of Cocoa beans export. Asian countries come next and they could potentially increase their market share and fill the gap between supply and demand.</p>

<p>Specifically in India, the southern states of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu grow cocoa. Producers in these states could use this crisis as an opportunity to produce fine quality cacao beans. <a href="https://manamchocolate.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank">Manam Chocolate</a> is barely a year od, but has created a mark for itself by bagging the prestigous International Chocolate Award. Its sister brand, <a href="https://www.distinctorigins.com/">Distinct Origins</a> is working actively towards enhancing both the quantity and the quality of cacao grown in the country. They are onboarding farmers and bringing in proprietary technologies to improve the fermentation, drying and other post harvest processes. This initiative will take 3 - 4 years to bear fruit but is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>I came across this word Cacao in a few articles that I read to research for this article. I genuinely thought it was a typo <iconify-icon inline="" icon="openmoji:smiling-face-with-halo" aria-label="Icon smiling-face-with-halo from openmoji Iconify.design set." title="Icon smiling-face-with-halo from openmoji Iconify.design set." width="36" height="36"></iconify-icon>. Turns out its not. Cacao refers to the raw material: the cacao beans that are harvested from the cacao tree. Cocoa is created after the beans are finely ground into a powder and roasted, and can be consumed as a drink or blended with sugar, milk, cocoa butter and cacao to make chocolate.</p>

<p>The US Dollar, also known as the greenback, is the dominant reserve currency in the world. Around 60% of all international trade is setlled in the US dollar and most countries prefer storing the excess reservces in US dollars. Why is that countries prefer trading in the dollar, when that’s not their local currency. This article tries to understand this puzzling practice.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-reserve-currency" class="level1">
<h1>What is a reserve currency?</h1>
<p>Before we go any further, we need to understand what a reserve currency is and its need. A reserve currency is a foreign currency that a central bank of a country holds its assets (reserves) in, besides its own local currency.</p>
<p>Many countries can not borrow money or pay for imported goods in their own currency, primarily because the country exporting the goods is not willing to trade in the importing country’s currency. For example, if Indian traders were to import good from China, they would need to settle the trade in US dollars, rather than in Indian Rupees or the Chinese Yuan. Why is that? Chinese exporters believe that the Indian Rupee is not stable and may lose value in the future. They therefore want to trade in a currency that they can hold without the risk of it losing its value, something that’s considered to be stable, like the US dollar.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the body responsible for monitoring the international monetary system, recognizes eight major reserve currencies: the Australian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar, the Chinese Renminbi, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the US Dollar. Among these, the US dollar is without any doubt the most commonly held reserve currency, making up 59% of global foreign exchange reserves. The Euro comes in a distant second, amounting to 20% of foreign exchange reserves.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-is-the-us-dollar-so-dominant" class="level1">
<h1>Why is the US Dollar so dominant?</h1>
<p>Before the US dollar became the defacto reserve currency, each country would peg the value of its local currency with respect to the amount of gold it held in its reserve. Thus came the term “Gold Standard”. It was technically possible to exchange the local currency for an equal amount in gold and hence each country was required to hold as much gold in its reserve as it had its currency in circulation.</p>
<p>However, as World War I broke out in 1914, many countries suspended the gold standard to pay for their military expenses. And during World War II, the US served as the Allies supplier of weapons. Most countries paid for this in gold, making the US the largest owner of gold reserves by the end of the war. Since most countries had depleted their gold reserves a return to gold standard was impossible.</p>
<section id="the-bretton-woods-agreement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bretton-woods-agreement">The Bretton Woods Agreement</h2>
<p>In 1944, delegates from 44 allied countries agreed to peg their currency against the US dollar as an alternative to the gold standard. The US dollar was chosen since US held the largest gold reserves at that time and it agreed to continue to follow the gold standard. As per the agreement, a country could redeem its US dollar reserves for an equal amount of gold on demand. The US dollar was thus crowned the worlds reserve currency.</p>
<p>The system seemed fair and not to anyones disadvantage. Countries retained some degree of control over their currency in case it became too strong or too weak relative to the dollar. They could sell or buy their currency to regulate money supply and bring their currency back to levels they felt comfortable.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="does-the-us-follow-the-gold-standard-even-today">Does the US follow the gold standard even today?</h2>
<p>Short answer, not any more.</p>
<p>In due course of time, the US flooded the market with paper money to service demands for its US treasury securities and to fund its own domestic programs and its war in Vietnam. Sensing concerns over the stability of the US dollar,countries started converting their US dollars into gold. The demand for this conversion was so high, that President Nixon had to step-in and announce economic policies in 1971 (referred to as the Nixon Shock) delinking the US dollar and the gold, which led to the current system of floating echange rates.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="how-does-the-us-benefit" class="level1">
<h1>How does the US benefit?</h1>
<p>The appetite for dollars among central banks across the world, provides US a cheap way to finance its expenditure. Given the demand, US can issue treasury securities at low yields and hence contain its cost to borrow money.</p>
<p>While not a financial benefit, the pivotal role the dollar plays in international trade, accords US the power to impose financial sanctions, and influence how countries repond to situations. Almost all trade done in US dollars, even trade among other countries, can be subject to US sanctions, because they are handled by correspondent banks with accounts at the Federal Reserve.</p>
</section>
<section id="dedollarization" class="level1">
<h1>Dedollarization</h1>
<p>Dedollarization refers to groups of countries coming together and deciding to trade in their own local currencies, instead of the dollar, in order to remove their dependence on the dollar. While talks to dedollarize have always been happening in the background, it came into focus amidst recent geo-political tensions. After Russia invaded Ukraine, America froze nearly 640 billion dollars of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves in US dollars. Countries fear that their assets may also be similarly frozen should they antoganize US.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they fear that their US dollar reserves may get devalued should the dollar inflation set in. This could happen as a result of increased US deficit spending and printing of US treasury securities to support its debt.</p>
<p>China has for long has tried to promote international use of its currency. Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are opting to trade in national or alternative currencies for international settlements. For instance, Brazil is partnering with Argentia to launch a joint currency called “sur” (south) that may eventially become South America’s Euro and be adopted by other countries of the continent. India is in talks with the UAE to trade non-oil commodities in Indian Rupees. Some central banks are touting Government backed digital currencies as an alternative.</p>
<p>Amidst this debate, will the dollar lose its crown in the future. Well experts don’t seem to think so, though they do believe it may slowly share its influence with other currencies.</p>

  <title>Subprime Crisis</title>
  <dc:creator>Satvik Raman</dc:creator>
  <link>https://satvikraman.github.io/blog/20240407/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We referred to the subprime crisis in the <a href="../../blog/20240331/index.html">Collapse of the Lehman Brothers</a> post. Let’s dive deeper into the crisis itself here.</p>
<p>The subprime crisis refers to the collapse of the US housing market in 2007-2008 that caused the failure of many financial institutions including investments banks, insurance companies and mortgage lenders. It was the onset of the Great Recession (2007-2009), that’s regarded as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</p>
<section id="causes" class="level1">
<h1>Causes</h1>
<section id="lowering-of-federal-interest-rates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lowering-of-federal-interest-rates">Lowering of Federal Interest Rates</h2>
<p>US Federal reserve lowered interest rates to give a boost to the US economy after the dot-com bubble of 2000 and the 9/11 attacks in 2001. They reduced the interest rate 11 times from May 2000 to Dec 2001 <sup>1</sup>. Interest rates were lowered from ~6% in 2001 to about ~1% in 2003 <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>. Lower interest rates allowed businesses to borrow and invest resulting in economic growth. With more disposable income at hand, the demand for homes increased which also resulted in an increased demand for mortgages.</p>
<p>With rising home ownership levels, banks had difficulty finding new home buyers and resorted to lending to subprime borrowers to maintain the growth of their loans. Subprime borrowers were those who would traditionally not qualify for a loan. The extent to which lending standards had been relaxed can be guaged by the fact that NINJA loans were also being offered. NINJA was an acronym for No Income, No Job or Assests. Essentially anyone willing to take a loan was being offered a loan. The low interest rate regime certainly helped fuel this exaggerated demand for homes and mortgages.</p>
</section>
<section id="restructuring-of-banking-loans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="restructuring-of-banking-loans">Restructuring of banking loans</h2>
<p>Changes in banking laws allowed banks to offfer loans to subprime customers with balloon payments or Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM). Balloon payments refers to an arrangement where large payments are intentionally shifted right towards the end of the loan period. It is obvious balloon payments would result in a higher interest component in the overall loan repayment schedule. Nevertheless it worked as a win-win solution. As banks earned a higher interest income, borrowers who couldn’t afford to start repaying their loans immediately were enabled to avail these loans by shifting their payments to a later date. ARMs also helped sub-prime borrowers by initially keeping the interest rates fixed and at relatively low leves and then keeping it a few percentage points higher with respect to the federal funds rate.</p>
<p>Both balloon payments and ARMs enticed people into taking loans they couldn’t afford. Until the housing prices were increasing, subprime borrowers were able to protect themselves by either refinancing their loans or borrowing against the increased value of their homes or even selling their homes at a profit and paying off their mortgages. In case of a default or a foreclosure, the banks would repossess the property and sell it for an amount higher than the original loan and book profits. Since it seemed like a relatively safe way to make money, banks started aggressively marketing subprime loans and their share in their books increased from about 2.5% to about 15% from 1990’s to 2004-07.</p>
</section>
<section id="securitization-of-mortgages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="securitization-of-mortgages">Securitization of mortgages</h2>
<p>Further contributing to the growth of subprime mortgages was the practice of securitizing mortgages. Banks would bundle subprime mortgages and sell them in the capital markets as securities (bonds). These bonds were known as Mortgage Back Securities (MBSs). MBS is a derivative product and is an output of a stream of study called financial engineering. Derivatives derive their value from an underlying assest, which in this case were the mortgages. The MBS buyer was entitled to a share of the interest and principal payments on the underlying loan. These MBSs could also be traded in the capital market and their prices steadily increased until the home prices continued their meteoric rise and until there were no defaults on the mortgages. MBSs were thus considered a sure way of earning profits and hence were very popular with the financial institutions. In some sense by selling MBSs, the banks were no longer lending money from their own reserves. Rather they acted as a broker between the borrower and the financial institutions buying the MBSs.</p>
</section>
<section id="dilution-of-the-net-capital-requirement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dilution-of-the-net-capital-requirement">Dilution of the net-capital requirement</h2>
<p>In 2004, SEC reduced the Net Capital Requirement (NCR). NCR refers to the minimum ratio of liquid capital to risk weighted assets, financial institutions are required to maintain as a safeguard measure. Put other ways, for every risky asset a financial institutions owns, they are expectd to also have liquid capital amounting to a certain percetage of the value of the risky asset. Should the risky asset lose value, the liquid capital with the financial institution would allow it to continue its operation. A lower NCR increases the leverage financial institutions can use. This increases business risk, should their assets turn sour.</p>
<p>An MBS is certainly an example of a risky asset. A lower NCR mandate by the SEC, allowed financial institutions to invest in MBS’s more than what would have been allowed otherwise. While this helped financial institutions earn big profits when the going was good, it also resulted in a greater than desired exposure to risky assets, since the rise in the value of the MBS’s was based on the premise that the housing prices would continue to rise.</p>

<h1>Keys Events Leading to the Crisis</h1>
<section id="rise-in-federal-interest-rates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rise-in-federal-interest-rates">Rise in Federal Interest Rates</h2>
<p>From 2004 to 2006, the US Federal Reserve did a U-turn on the interest rate trajectory and raised the interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%. Subprime borrowers who chose ARM mortgages saw their lending interest rates go up, which led to a higher EMI payment than they could afford and eventually defaulted. Since the housing bubble had reached a level of saturation, the housing prices were no longer increasing as they had in the past. The subprime borrowers were unable to resort to the old trick of refinancing their loans, borrowing against the increased value of their house or selling their house for profits to repay their mortgages. As more and more subprime borrowers defaulted, the MBS’s lost value, resulting in a loss to the financial institutions holding them. Since these MBSs were also bought and sold in countries outside the US, the impact of this crisis spread globally.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="irony-in-the-midst-of-the-crisis">Irony in the midst of the crisis</h2>
<p>Rating agencies that had initially given a 5 star rating to the MBS’s were now treating them as toxic or worthless assets. It became apparent that conflict of interest guided their initial 5 star rating decision since they were paid by the same banks whose MBS’s they were rating.</p>

</p><p>I have a close association with this story. I was born on the exact day Lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy, September 15, 2008. I therefore wanted to start my blog series by exploring what led to the Lehman Brother’s fall.</p>
<section id="history" class="level1">
<h1>History :</h1>
<p>The history of Lehman brothers dates back to 1884, when the three German brothers Henry, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman ran a general store in Alabama where farmers paid for their goods using cotton. Tailwinds from the US economy’s growth, helped them grow to become the 4th largest investment bank in the country. It weathered many financial storms along the way, but, a downturn in the US housing market combined with a heavily leveraged position ultimately led to its downfall.</p>
</section>
<section id="subprime-crisis-and-mortgage-backed-securities" class="level1">
<h1>Subprime Crisis and Mortgage Backed Securities :</h1>
<p>Lehman Brothers branched out into Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO). In the euphoria that preceeded the US housing market bubble, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders along with BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans and it seemed like it had the Midas’s touch.</p>

<p>Lehman’s real estate business made a lot of money in the capital markets unit by securitizing morgages. In simple terms, banks that lent money to the home buyers, bundled mortgages as securities and sold them to investment banks like Lehman. Lehman securitized $146 billion worth of mortgages in 2006 alone. This helped their revenue grow by 56% from 2004 to 2006 and allowed them to report record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In February 2007, Lehman’s stock price reached an all time high driving its market capitalization to nearly $60 billion.</p>

<p>The value of a security is based on the quality of its underlying assert. The underlying asset of the MBSs &amp; CDOs that Lehman was buying were the mortgages. If there were no defaults on the mortgages, the MBS buyer would benefit. If, however, the mortgages were not paid back in full, the MBS would get devalued, on account of the detiorating quality of the underlying mortgages, resulting in a loss to the MBS buyer.</p>
<p>Lehman and its subsidiaries were buying securities backed by Alt-A and sub-prime mortgages. The risk of these mortgages getting sour was always high. When the cracks in the US housing market started to appear in the first quarter of 2007, defaults on the sub-prime mortages rose to a seven year high leading to a massive devaluation of the MBSs and CDOs they had purchased. Lehman’s stock price dropped massively when the credit crisis deepened in August 2007. In that month, the company got rid of mortgage related jobs and closed its BNC unit. It also shut down offices of Aurora, an Alt-A mortgage lender, in many states.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="heavily-leveraged-position">Heavily leveraged position</h2>
<p>Despite this, in 2007, Lehman bought more MBS than any other company. They built up a portfolio, worth $85 billion, of these securities, which was worth 4 times it shareholder’s equity. Lehman was leaning forward and using financial leverage to fund its purchase completely ignoring all the warning signs.</p>

<p>As can be seen in Figure&nbsp;2, the use of leverage was increasing in each of the major investment banks since 2003. In 2007, Lehman had an exceptionally high level of leverage, 31:1 and its huge portfolio of MBS made it very vulnerable to the worsening US housing market conditions. At such a high leverage even a small correction in the value of the MBS would have had a huge impact on Lehman’s portfolio. And in 2008, we were not talking about a small correction. When the housing market in the US went into a tail-spin, also referred to as the sub-prime crisis, mortgage defaults spiralled and so did Lehman’s problems.</p>

<h1>Implosion</h1>
<p>Lehman’s stock came under heavy selling pressure, since it was clear that the mortgage defaults would hurt their MBS portfolio. With more sellers than buyers, Lehman’s stock dived 77% in the first week of September 2008 alone. Many attempts were made to steady the sinking ship; Lehman tried spinning off its commercial real estate assets as a separate entity; There were talks with the Korean Development Bank to invest in Lehman; And even Barclays and Bank of America made a last ditch attempt to takeover Lehman, but they all failed. And as news of each failed attempt appeared, Lehman’s stock dived down even further.</p>
<p>With only $1 billion left in cash, on September 15, 2008, Lehman declared bankruptcy, which caused the stock to fall by 93% from its previous close on September 12.</p>

<p>When I first read about this story, I wondered how Lehman was able to fund a leverage of 31:1. Surely there must be a financing cost associated with all the money they were borrowing. And it was not just Lehman, every other investment bank seemed to be doing it. The remainder of the post delves into this topic.</p>
<section id="dollar-economics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dollar-economics">Dollar Economics</h3>
<p>Post the World War II, global trading moved towards the US dollar. Central banks around the world were thus flush with dollar reserves and since they wanted to earn a yield on these reserves, these reserves eventually got invested into American treasury securities and other American debt securities. All this money coming into the US helped keep interest rates low. Look at it this way, the US government didn’t have to give any special incentives to attract this money. Money kept flowing into the US and the government continued to keep the treasury interest rates low. See Figure&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>Treasury securities are issued by the US government to fund its budget deficit, or the amount the government borrows to fill the gap between what it earns and what it spends. Treasury securities offer a fixed interest rate if held until its maturity and are considered the safest form of investment.</p>

<p>The yield on the treasury securities sets a reference for the overall interest rate scenario in the country. As lending to individuals and corporates is considered riskier than lending to the government, individuals and corporates are lent money at an interest rate that’s relatively higher than the yield on the treasure securities. This is done to compensate for the additional risk being taken. The risk profile of the borrower determines how much higher the interest rates are pegged in comparison to the yield on the treasury securities. But since the yield on the treasury securities was low to start with, individuals, banks and corporates were able to borrow money at reasonably low interest rates.</p>
<p>This allowed banks and financial firms to borrow more and more money in order to speculate in the financial markets and spruce up their returns. It also allowed individuals to borrow more than what they could ever repay and that eventually led to the real estate bubble. The total household debt in the US, went up dramatically from $7.2 trillion in early 2003 to a peak of $12.7 trillion in 2008.</p>

<p>In my opinion trading in US dollar has created a viscious cycle. Americans borrowed at low interest rates and bought cars from Japan and apparels and electronics from China. China and Japan would invest the earned dollars back into US by buying their treasury securities. Because of inflow of dollars, the US Government kept their interest rates low allowing Americans to borrow even more and so the cycle continued.</p>

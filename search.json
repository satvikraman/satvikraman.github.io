    "text": "So what is leverage?\nLeverage comes from the word lever. Remeber the simple machine you read about back in your school days. A lever helps us lift objects by applying lesser force.\nAnalogous to that, a financial leverage helps us invest larger sums by using less of our own money. Let’s work with an example. Assume you have $10 and you borrow $100 from a bank to invest a total of $110. Your financial leverage is 10:1 i.e. for every $1 of your own money you are borrowing $10.\nAssume, the investment works in your favour, and you make a return of 20%. Because of the leverage, your returns are $22 (20% of $110) which would be significantly larger than the $2 (20% of $10) you would have made had you not leveraged your position. Thats a 220% return ($22/$10%). Wow!!!\nBut lets also look at the flip side. What if the investment does not work in our favour and we incur a loss of 5%. Because of the leverage, your loss will be $5.5 (5% of 110) which is again significantly larger than $0.5 (5% of 10) you would have lost had you not leveraged your position. While in absolute terms a $5.5 loss may not sound large, in percentage terms, with a 10:1 leverage, with a 5% drop, you have lost more than 50% ($5.5/$10%) of your capital. Thats massive.\nJust to see, how quickly a leveraged position can wreck havoc on your investments, assume if you continued to hold your leveraged positions shown above even after incurring the loss. The 5% loss has reduced our capital to $4.5 ($10 - %5.5) thereby increasing our leverage to roughly 22:1 i.e. (100/4.5:1). Another 5% loss from here (and that’s not unheard of, when things get bad) can wipe out our entire capital and more, leaving us with a pile of debt to clear.\nInvesting a leveraged position is like a roller coster ride. Higher the leverage, higher are the ups and the downs. No one complains when the going is good, but when panic strikes, and its said fear spreads much faster than greed, things can very quickly get out of control."

    "text": "But isn’t there a cost associated with financial leveragw\nThe main reason for a lot of leverage was the extremely low interest rates in the US. The interest rates were low because a lot of money from other countries was coming into the US and was being used to buy treasury securities from the US government. Treasury securities are issued by the US government to finance its budget deficit, or the difference between what it earns and what it spends."

Lehman was leaning forward and using financial leverage to fund its purchase completely ignoring all the warning signs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Levarage ratios for major investment banks 2\n\n\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 2, the use of leverage was increasing in each of the major investment banks since 2003. In 2007, Lehman had an exceptionally high level of leverage, 31:1 and its huge portfolio of MBS made it very vulnerable to the worsening US housing market conditions. At such a high leverage even a small correction in the value of the MBS would have had a huge impact on Lehman’s portfolio. And in 2008, we were not talking about a small correction. When the housing market in the US went into a tail-spin, also referred to as the sub-prime crisis, mortgage defaults spiralled and so did Lehman’s problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a leveraged position?\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveraged position or financial leverage is the act of borrowing money to invest.

    "text": "How could Lehman afford such high leverage\nWhen I first read about this story, I wondered how Lehman was able to fund a leverage of 31:1. Surely there must be a financing cost associated with all the money they were borrowing. And it was not just Lehman, every other investment bank seemed to be doing it. The remainder of the post delves into this topic.\n\nDollar Economics\nPost the World War II, global trading moved towards the US dollar. Central banks around the world were thus flush with dollar reserves and since they wanted to earn a yield on these reserves, these reserves eventually got invested into American treasury securities and other American debt securities. All this money coming into the US helped keep interest rates low. Look at it this way, the US government didn’t have to give any special incentives to attract this money. Money kept flowing into the US and the government continued to keep the treasury interest rates low. See Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are treasury securities?\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasury securities are issued by the US government to fund its budget deficit, or the amount the government borrows to fill the gap between what it earns and what it spends. Treasury securities offer a fixed interest rate if held until its maturity and are considered the safest form of investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Yield on the 10 year Americal treasury 3\n\n\n\nThe yield on the treasury securities sets a reference for the overall interest rate scenario in the country. As lending to individuals and corporates is considered riskier than lending to the government, individuals and corporates are lent money at an interest rate that’s relatively higher than the yield on the treasure securities. This is done to compensate for the additional risk being taken. The risk profile of the borrower determines how much higher the interest rates are pegged in comparison to the yield on the treasury securities. But since the yield on the treasury securities was low to start with, individuals, banks and corporates were able to borrow money at reasonably low interest rates.\nThis allowed banks and financial firms to borrow more and more money in order to speculate in the financial markets and spruce up their returns. It also allowed individuals to borrow more than what they could ever repay and that eventually led to the real estate bubble. The total household debt in the US, went up dramatically from $7.2 trillion in early 2003 to a peak of $12.7 trillion in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Rise in US household debt\n\n\n\nIn my opinion trading in US dollar has created a viscious cycle. Americans borrowed at low interest rates and bought cars from Japan and apparels and electronics from China. China and Japan would invest the earned dollars back into US by buying their treasury securities. Because of inflow of dollars, the US Government kept their interest rates low allowing Americans to borrow even more and so the cycle continued.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: The Viscious Cycle\n---\nstateDiagram-v2\n  USGB: US Government Borrowed\n  TRL: US government kept treasury interest rates low\n  USB: US borrowed at low interest rates\n  USS: US Spent\n  CJE: China / Japan earned\n  CJL: China / Japan lent\n  USB --&gt; USS\n  USS --&gt; CJE\n  CJE --&gt; CJL\n  CJL --&gt; USGB\n  USGB --&gt; TRL\n  TRL --&gt; USB"

    "text": "Leverage comes from the word lever. Remember the simple machine you read about in physics back in your school days. A lever helps us lift objects by applying lesser force.\n\n\n\n\n\nGive me a lever long enough… and I shall move the world\n\n\nAnalogous to that, a financial leverage helps us invest larger sums by using less of our own money. In simple terms, when you invest borrowed money you are using financial leverage. Leverage boosts returns if the trade works favourably. However, it is a double edged sword. If the trade does not go as planned it will also exaggerate the losses. Leverage therefore works like a magnifying glass, magnifying both gains and losses.\nLet’s work with an example. For the purpose of this discussion lets ignore the any additional cost including that of financing, brokerage etc… We will only focus on the impact of leverage in isolation.\nAssume you have $100 and you borrow another $100 to invest a total of $200. This is a financial leverage of 1:1 i.e. for every $1 of your own money you are borrowing another $1.\nThe yield curve for the 1:1 leverage and no leverage positions are drawn in red and green colour respectively in the “Example” tab of Figure 1. The “X” axis is the return that a security can provide. The “Y” axis is the return experienced by trading in that security. Ideally the return experienced by trading a security should be the same as the return provided by the security, the green line. However, with leverage, the returns experienced gets magnified and thats the red line.\n\nplotVals = []\ninitial_capital = 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\n  for(let leverage = 0; leverage &lt; 100; leverage+=1) {\n    let leveraged_capital = initial_capital * (1 + leverage)\n    {\n      for (let move_perc = -50; move_perc &lt;= 50; move_perc+=10) {       \n        let corpus = leveraged_capital * (1 + move_perc/100)\n        let pnl = corpus - leveraged_capital\n        let pnl_perc = pnl * 100 / initial_capital\n\n        plotVals.push({\"Market Return %\": move_perc, \"Portfolio Return %\": pnl_perc, \"lev\": leverage})\n      }\n    }  \n  }\n  return\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamplePlotInteractive\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  x: {domain: [-100, 100], grid: true},\n  y: {domain: [-100, 100], grid: true},\n  marks: [\n      Plot.gridX({interval: 5, stroke: \"#d2d2d2\", strokeOpacity: 0.5}),\n      Plot.gridY({interval: 5, stroke: \"#d2d2d2\", strokeOpacity: 0.5}),\n\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 0), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"red\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 1), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"green\"}),\n      Plot.ruleX([20], {y1: 0, y2: 40, stroke: \"#b2b2b2\"}),\n      Plot.ruleX([-10], {y1: 0, y2: -20, stroke: \"#b2b2b2\"}),\n      Plot.ruleY([20, 40], {x1: -100, x2: 20, stroke: \"#b2b2b2\"}),\n      Plot.ruleY([-10, -20], {x1: -100, x2: -10, stroke: \"#b2b2b2\"}),\n      Plot.ruleY([0], {stroke: \"blue\"}),\n      Plot.ruleX([0], {stroke: \"blue\"}),\n    ],\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1:1 leverage yield curve used as an example in the text\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  grid: true,\n  x: {domain: [-50, 50], grid: true},\n  y: {domain: [-100, 100], grid: true},\n  marks: [\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 0), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 1), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 2), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 4), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 5), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 10), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 20), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 30), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 40), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 50), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"})\n    ],\n  color: {legend: true}\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA graph showing the yield curve at different leverage ratios\n\n\n\nviewof leverage = Inputs.range(\n  [1, 100], \n  {value: 1, step: 1, label: \"Leverage ratio:\"}\n)\n\nPlot.plot({\n  grid: true,\n  x: {domain: [-50, 50], grid: true},\n  y: {domain: [-100, 100], grid: true},\n  marks: [\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == 0), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"}),\n      Plot.line(plotVals.filter(d =&gt; d.lev == leverage), {x: \"Market Return %\", y: \"Portfolio Return %\", stroke: \"lev\"})\n    ],\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove the slider to see how the slope of the yield curve change with leverage\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Slippery slope: Yield curve of a non leveraged position (black) vs. a leveraged position\n\n\n\nContinuing with the “Example” tab, assume that the security moves favourably by 20%. Because of the leverage, your returns are $40 (20% of $200) which is significantly larger than the $20 (20% of $100) you would have made without it. A $40 return translates to a 40% return on your initial capital of $100, even though the security moved only by 20%. In percentage terms, a 1:1 leverage, doubles your gain percentage. A 10% gain in the security, causes you to gain 20% of your capital. Isn’t that awesome.\nBut lets also look at the flip side. What if the market security in the opposite direction by 10%. Because of the leverage, your loss will be $20 (10% of $200) which is again significantly larger than $10 (10% of $100) you would have lost had you not leveraged your position. Similar to the favourable case above, in percentage terms, a 1:1 leverage, doubles your loss percentage. A 10% drop in the security, causes you to lose 20% of your capital.\nLeverage can be addictive, more so if you experienced beginner’s luck. However, if your trades don’t work out and you continue using leverage it can quickly wipe out your investing capital. The use of leverage without adequate caution can be disastrous.\nRefer the “Plot” tab in Figure 1. I compare leverage to a slippery slope. The different coloured lines depict the yield curve at different leverages. The leverage ratio increases as the color transitions from black  blue  green  yellow  red. Higher the leverage, higher is the slope of the yield curve which translates to a higher boost to both your gain and loss. No one complains when the going is good. But when panic strikes, and fear spreads much faster than greed, things can very quickly get out of control.\nIf you want a more interactive feel to see how quickly the slope of the yield curve changes switch to the “Interactive” tab in Figure 1 and play with the slide rule. You would notice that the slope increases quite rapidly with every unit change in the leverage. And as the slope increases, so does the risk.\nIt is worth noting that certain financial instruments have leverage built into them. Many brokers provide leverage on intra-day trading. Derivative products like futures and options also provide leverage. These financial instruments therefore need to be used with proper knowledge and abundant caution. As Warren Buffett said, “When you combine ignorance and leverage you get some pretty interesting results”\n\n\nThere is of couse a cost associated with financial leverage. Since financial leverage is nothing short of borrowing money, the borrower would need to pay a financing cost proportional to the interest rate and the principal being borrowed to the lender. While buying securities, this is often factored into the brokerage pricing.\nThe use of financial leverage could be justified, if the money is available cheap and the borrower expects to make a larger return than the financing cost. This way the borrower would be able to repay the borrowed amount and the financing cost and still retain a portion of the profits. However, since the markets can have a mind of their own and act finicky, it would make sense to hedge your leveraged positions to limit your losses should things not go the way you had thought it would."

Because of the leverage, your returns are $40 (20% of $200) which is significantly larger than the $20 (20% of $100) you would have made without it. A $40 return translates to a 40% return on your initial capital of $100, even though the security moved only by 20%. In percentage terms, a 1:1 leverage, doubles your gain percentage. A 10% gain in the security, causes you to gain 20% of your capital. Isn’t that awesome.\nBut lets also look at the flip side. What if the market security in the opposite direction by 10%. Because of the leverage, your loss will be $20 (10% of $200) which is again significantly larger than $10 (10% of $100) you would have lost had you not leveraged your position. Similar to the favourable case above, in percentage terms, a 1:1 leverage, doubles your loss percentage. A 10% drop in the security, causes you to lose 20% of your capital.\nLeverage can be addictive, more so if you experienced beginner’s luck. However, if your trades don’t work out and you continue using leverage it can quickly wipe out your investing capital. The use of leverage without adequate caution can be disastrous.\nRefer the “Plot” tab in Figure 1. I compare leverage to a slippery slope. The different coloured lines depict the yield curve at different leverages. The leverage ratio increases as the color transitions from black  blue  green  yellow  red. Higher the leverage, higher is the slope of the yield curve which translates to a higher boost to both your gain and loss. No one complains when the going is good. But when panic strikes, and fear spreads much faster than greed, things can very quickly get out of control.\nIf you want a more interactive feel to see how quickly the slope of the yield curve changes switch to the “Interactive” tab in Figure 1 and play with the slide rule. You would notice that the slope increases quite rapidly with every unit change in the leverage. And as the slope increases, so does the risk.\nIt is worth noting that certain financial instruments have leverage built into them. Many brokers provide leverage on intra-day trading. Derivative products like futures and options also provide leverage. These financial instruments therefore need to be used with proper knowledge and abundant caution. As Warren Buffett said, “When you combine ignorance and leverage you get some pretty interesting results”"

    "text": "So what is leverage?\nLeverage comes from the word lever. Remeber the simple machine you read about back in your school days. A lever helps us lift objects by applying lesser force.\nAnalogous to that, a financial leverage helps us invest larger sums by using less of our own money. Let’s work with an example. Assume you have $10 and you borrow $100 from a bank to invest a total of $110. Your financial leverage is 10:1 i.e. for every $1 of your own money you are borrowing $10.\nAssume, the investment works in your favour, and you make a return of 20%. Because of the leverage, your returns are $22 (20% of $110) which would be significantly larger than the $2 (20% of $10) you would have made had you not leveraged your position. Thats a 220% return ($22/$10%). Wow!!!\nBut lets also look at the flip side. What if the investment does not work in our favour and we incur a loss of 5%. Because of the leverage, your loss will be $5.5 (5% of 110) which is again significantly larger than $0.5 (5% of 10) you would have lost had you not leveraged your position. While in absolute terms a $5.5 loss may not sound large, in percentage terms, with a 10:1 leverage, with a 5% drop, you have lost more than 50% ($5.5/$10%) of your capital. Thats massive.\nJust to see, how quickly a leveraged position can wreck havoc on your investments, assume if you continued to hold your leveraged positions shown above even after incurring the loss. The 5% loss has reduced our capital to $4.5 ($10 - %5.5) thereby increasing our leverage to roughly 22:1 i.e. (100/4.5:1). Another 5% loss from here (and that’s not unheard of, when things get bad) can wipe out our entire capital and more, leaving us with a pile of debt to clear.\nInvesting a leveraged position is like a roller coster ride. Higher the leverage, higher are the ups and the downs. No one complains when the going is good, but when panic strikes, and its said fear spreads much faster than greed, things can very quickly get out of control."

The interest rates were low because a lot of money from other countries was coming into the US and was being used to buy treasury securities from the US government. Treasury securities are issued by the US government to finance its budget deficit, or the difference between what it earns and what it spends."

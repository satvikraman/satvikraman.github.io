# What are Prime, SubPrime and Alt-A loans?
Prime, Subprime and Alt-A are classification of loans / mortgages based on credit worthiness of the borrower. 

The word "prime" in prime mortgage indicates good quality. Prime mortgages are good quality mortgages. Quality here refers to the quanta of risk associated with the loan; risk that the borrower may not repay the loan. Higher the quality, lower is the risk. 

The prefix "sub" means lower and consequently, sub-prime mortgages refers to mortgages that are of a lower quality than prime mortgages. 

Alt-A loans carry a risk that is somewhere in between that of a prime and a sub-prime mortgage. They are riskier than a prime mortgage but not as risky as a subprime mortgage. 

## Why would lenders give riskier loans?
The answer lies in the monetary incentives should the risk not materialize. The fact that the loan is riskier does not necessarily mean that the loan will not be repaid. To compensate for the risk, lenders loan the amount at a higher interest rate and hence earn more on riskier loans. 


## How do the banks mitigate the risk of the borrower defaulting? 
Typically, once a bank detects some kind of a risk or default with a loan, it qualifies it as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). A loan being classified as a NPA does not necessarily mean that it will not be paid. However it does reflect a risk, and based on the quanta of risk, banks need to set aside or "provision" a percentage of the loan amount to cover potential losses should the risk materialize.

Provisioning helps banks mitigate the impact of NPAs on their financial health. It ensures banks have enough capital to cover for potential losses and continue operations even if a some borrowers default.
